## Description


My motivation was to get a coding JOB! I wanted to create a website that shows my portfolio to future employers. To show that I am, or will be, a qualified employee.  Also to build a website that resembles my currents skills and be able to show my growth as I continue to improve and grow as a coder.
I built this webpage to show future employers that I am a qualified, future qualified, employee.  I built it to show off my current coding skills.
The problem it solves is helping employers find a qualified canidate, me.
I learned that I know very little coding.  That coding takes time, practice. I learned that you have to deal with frustration, and keep at it.
